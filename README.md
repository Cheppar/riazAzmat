## Project Proposal
Hey Azmat this is an outline of how I want to achieve tasks under a time frame.

### Outline

#### Why I am at 73%.
I acknowledge my work and all consequences affiliated to it.
Going through my profile you will realise that I am good at map based JavaScript.
For new roles like indoor mapping I was rated fairly (3.0/5) , JSON styling 3.55/5
Moreover, you may go through the clients feedback as proof.
